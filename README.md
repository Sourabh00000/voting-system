# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description
A secure, transparent, and tamper-proof decentralized voting platform built using Ethereum smart contracts. It ensures that every vote is counted accurately and verifiably without relying on centralized authorities.

Here are five smart contract-based project ideas for voting or governance:
1. **Token-based Weighted Voting**: Votes are weighted by the number of tokens a user holds.
2. **Quadratic Voting**: Allows users to vote multiple times with increasing cost per vote.
3. **Anonymous Voting using zk-SNARKs**: Privacy-preserving voting system.
4. **Multi-phase Elections**: Different smart contracts handle registration, voting, and result tallying separately.
5. **Delegated Voting System (Liquid Democracy)**: Voters can delegate their votes to trusted representatives.

## Project Vision
To empower transparent, tamper-proof, and fair elections on the blockchain—giving every eligible user an equal voice through decentralized governance.

## Key Features
- Admin-managed candidate and voter registration
- Only registered users can vote
- One-person-one-vote mechanism
- Live winner tally based on vote count
- Prevents double-voting and unauthorized voting

## Future Scope
- Integration with zk-SNARKs for anonymous voting
- Token-weighted voting for DAO use cases
- On-chain/off-chain hybrid UI with IPFS or The Graph
- Mobile integration with Web3 wallets like MetaMask
- Real-time analytics and election audit logs
